The AYP attracted more than 3.5 million visitors from around the world, giving Seattle much-needed prominence and attention as a leader in Pacific trade. The layout of the Exposition and its buildings were partly funded by the state legislature, so that they could later be used by the University. The San Francisco firm of Howard & Galloway was responsible for the design supervision of the fair's official buildings and sent their chief designer, Eduard Champney, to oversee the entire project. At the center of the Exposition was an area called the Arctic Circle, which featured six white buildings that arched around a mall and two fountains with a view of Mt. Rainier in the distance. The centrally placed U.S. Government Building featured exhibits from the nation's capital."},{"label":"Subjects (LCTGM)","value":"Elevations; Sketches"},{"label":"Subjects (LCSH)","value":"United States Government Building (Seattle, Wash.); Exhibition buildings--Washington (State)--Seattle--Designs and plans; Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition (1909 : Seattle, Wash.)"},{"label":"Digital Collection","value":"Architecture Collection"},{"label":"Order Number","value":"ARC0014"},{"label":"Ordering Information","value":"Restrictions apply to the ordering of this image.
